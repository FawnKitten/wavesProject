# wavesProject

this is my project for 8th grade science 
=========================================

I built this with javascript and a framework called p5.js 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I created a simulation using code to demonstrate my wave concept. My wave concept is
the interference of transverse waves. This is demonstrated by two waves and the 
interference pattern they create. Interference is when two waves in the same plane cross
each other, creating a greater or smaller waves. When two waves constructively interfere
they create a greater wave. This happens when waves that disturb in the same manner
cross each other. When two waves destructively interfere it creates a wave that is
smaller. This happens when waves that disturb in a different manner cross each other.
